## Objects and Purposes of OKXLabs Foundation
The objects and purposes for which the Foundation is established include the following:

1. To design, develop, build, deploy and maintain open-source, smart contracts on public blockchains, with a commitment to absolute decentralisation, ensuring all contracts will remain open-source tools for the Web3 community and will never take custody or control of any assets.
2. To ensure immutability by default for smart contracts relating to core logic and user funds. This means that such smart contracts must be non-upgradeable and/or immutable. The sole exception to this is for Solana contracts, which we acknowledge and understand cannot be immutable due to technical limitations.
3. To create and maintain infrastructure and protocols that contribute to the foundation of the Web3 space, including access to NFT marketplaces listing, DeFi protocols and customizable routes to DEXs. This includes a commitment to universal access, ensuring no whitelists, no fees and no restrictions such that the infrastructure and protocols may be usable by anyone.
4. To engage in educational, scientific or other lawful purposes as may be determined by the Council, in particular those aligned with decentralisation.
5. To hold, manage, administer and distribute assets for the benefit of the the Web3 community and developers contributing to this Foundation’s mission in accordance with the provisions of the Foundation's Charter and the Bylaws.
6. To provide for the maintenance, support and welfare of the Web3 community and developers contributing to this Foundation’s mission.
7. To carry out any and all acts necessary or incidental to the attainment of the object and purposes of the Foundation.
8. To work towards the transition to full decentralisation by leading the protocol’s development, governance and ecosystem growth until such time as the developer community is empowered to assume autonomous control.
